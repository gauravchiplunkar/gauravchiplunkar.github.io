    <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Global Economies and Markets group at the Darden School of Business, University of Virginia. My research lies at the intersection of labor, organizational, and development economics, with a focus on how labor market frictions, gender disparities, and digital technologies shape economic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
    <p>I combine experimental and quasi-experimental methods with structural macroeconomic models using rich administrative and high-frequency data. My work is grounded in fieldwork across multiple countries and connects micro-level behavior with macroeconomic patterns of productivity and structural transformation.</p>
    <p>I am a Research Affiliate at J-PAL, Y-RISE, Inclusion Economics, the Global Action for Policy Initiative, and the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).</p>
